# Amazon Alexa Skills to handle Chromecast

This is a learning project and a .Net port of a similar project that i found in 
[Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/pizzaface97/amazon-alexa-controlling-a-chromecast-a5f91f), the python source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Pizzaface/Alexa-Chromecast-Skill-2.0).


It Contains 2 parts one is a lamdba function hosted in AWS (thats what the skills for alexa needs) and then a locally running service to handle requests from cloud.
